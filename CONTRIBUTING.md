# Contributing to IO Bluetooth

IO Bluetooth welcomes contributions from everyone in the form of suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, and feedback. This document gives some guidance if you are thinking of helping us.

Please reach out here in a GitHub issue if we can do anything to help you contribute.

## Submitting bug reports and feature requests

When reporting a bug or asking for help, please include enough details so that the people helping you can reproduce the behavior you are seeing. For some tips on how to approach this, read about how to produce a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

When making a feature request, please make it clear what problem you intend to solve with the feature, any ideas for how IO Bluetooth could support solving that problem, any possible alternatives, and any disadvantages.
